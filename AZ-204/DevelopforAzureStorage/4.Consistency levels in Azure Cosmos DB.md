# Consistency levels in Azure Cosmos DB
Most commercially available distributed NoSQL databases available in the market today provide only strong and eventual consistency. Azure Cosmos DB offers five well-defined levels. From strongest to weakest, the levels are:

   âœ“ Strong

   âœ“ Bounded staleness

   âœ“ Session

   âœ“ Consistent prefix

   âœ“ Eventual

**Each level provides availability and performance tradeoffs. The following image shows the different consistency levels as a spectrum.**

## Strong Consistency

- Strong consistency is the strictest type of consistency available in CosmosDB. 
- The data is **synchronously replicated** to all the replicas in real-time. 
- This mode of consistency is useful for applications that cannot tolerate any data loss in case of downtime. Hence, the recovery point objective is Zero.

- The order of operation is preserved and the reads are guaranteed to return the most recent version of the item in the database. 
- The client always gets the latest changes in the data when requested.

- However, with strong consistency, there is a substantial increase in latency since every write must be replicated and committed to the new regions. 
  As I mentioned earlier, the longer the distance between the replicas, the longer the time it takes to write the changes to the database, hence the increased latency. 

- ðŸ‘‰ In summary, with strong consistency, **you get the highest consistency, lower performance, and lowest availability.** 
- The latency is also high and this type of model is best suited for Inventory applications, Financial transactions, Scheduling, or Forecasting workloads.

## Bounded Staleness
- In the Bounded Staleness level, data is replicated asynchronously with a predetermined staleness window defined either by numbers of writes or a period of time. 
- The reads query may lag behind by either a certain number of writes or by a pre-defined time period. However, the reads are guaranteed to honor the sequence of the data.
- ðŸ‘‰ In summary The performance of bounded staleness is better than the strong consistency however the availability is still low due to inherent lag for the replication. This level is used for apps that don't need to fetch data in real-time, however still in the order, it was written.

## Session
- The session consistency is the default consistency that you get while configuring the cosmos DB account. This level of consistency honors the client session.
- Whatever is written by a session will return the latest version for reads as well, from that same session.
- ðŸ‘‰ In summary, session consistency provides strong consistency for the session, ensuring the data stays up to date for any active read-write session. The availability of the data is relatively high with lower latency and higher throughput than the bounded staleness. 
- ðŸ‘‰ The possible candidate for this kind of model could be a typical e-commerce application, social media app, and other similar services with persistent user connection.

## Consistent Prefix
- The consistent prefix model is similar to bounded staleness except, the operational or time lag guarantee. The replicas guarantee the consistency and order of the writes however the data is not always current.
- This model provides high availability and very low latency which is best for certain applications that can afford the lag and still function as expected.

## Eventual
- Eventual consistency is the weakest consistency level of all. The first thing to consider in this model is that there is no guarantee on the order of the data and also no guarantee of how long the data can take to replicate. 
- ðŸ‘‰ As the name suggests, the reads are consistent, but eventually.
- ðŸ‘‰ This model offers high availability and low latency along with the highest throughput of all.
- The best usage of this type of model would be the count of retweets, likes, non-threaded comments where the count is more important than any other information.
